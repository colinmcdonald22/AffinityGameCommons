# AffinityGameCommons

This project was originally written in 2014, and pushed to GitHub in 2016.
My coding style has improved significantly since then.

Although this project wasn't directly used with more than 100 players, it served as
inspiration for projects like GameManager and qFramework at @FrozenOrb.

There are two major components of AGC: Games and GameCommons.

## GameCommons 
GameCommons is a basic framework for Minecraft minigames (starting, stopping, teams, kits, etc)
It centralizes common functionality, allow very small (sometimes even single file) games to be
developed rapidly.

## Games
Games contains 8 separate games, in varying states of completion, implemented on top of GameCommons.
